I am an architect from Mumbai, India currently enrolled in First year M.Arch 2 program at SoA at CMU. After graduation, I worked in Ahmedabad and Mumbai for a few years where I was exposed to a variety of architecture, urban design, landscape and master planning projects of variety of scales and sizes. I am currently enrolled in the Urban Design Build Studio where we are designing and building a replicable, market rate single family home with a broader goal of deconcentrating poverty and acheiving universal affordability. I have keen interest in Urban design and sustainability and I am pursuing courses in these disciplines here at CMU.
