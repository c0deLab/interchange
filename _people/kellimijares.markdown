I will graduate from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.Arch in May 2018. Currently, I am pursuing an architectural thesis which confronts current border politics and aims to subvert existing borders by speculating ambiguity of agency and control over space.

Outside of school, I am a curatorial assistant of Point Line Projectsâ€“exploring exhibitions of public interest design, methods of education, and inclusivity of the profession. These experiences inform my understanding of the built environment and the modes of architectural practices.

I am seeking opportunities to obtain licensure, to expand my vocabulary within the discourse, and to enhance design skills.
