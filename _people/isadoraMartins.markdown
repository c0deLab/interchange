I am a current fourth year B.Arch student from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with a potential history minor. I have worked at Bernardes Arquitetura in Rio de Janeiro and KoDA Miami and am seeking a summer internship and potential full time employment upon my 2019 graduation. I would like to work at an office that engages with different scale projects and continuously pushes the boundaries of what architecture should be.
