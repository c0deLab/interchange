Katelyn Smith is a current 5th year architecture student on the path to licensure looking for a full-time position. She believes in the importance of spaces that were designed with its users in mind, and seeks to use her interest in architecture for the service of people. For her, community engagement and client connection is the most important part of the design process. While studying at Carnegie Mellon, she developed an interest in the integration between architectural thinking and technology through product design, fabrication, 3D modeling, and animation.
