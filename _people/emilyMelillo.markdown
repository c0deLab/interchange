Informed by my high school studies and a lifelong passion for drawing, I pursued a professional path in architecture by attending the B.Arch program at Carnegie Mellon University and am currently in my fourth year.

My art is driven by my interest in fine details and capturing the delicacy of a moment in time. This reflects in my architectural work through my sensitivity towards the client or community at large. I believe that architecture is a form of art, and that art is the most powerful movement in the world.
