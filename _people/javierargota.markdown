Architect, urbanist, and technologist. I created my own design office called [JARD](http://www.jard.us) just after graduating with honors at the School of Architecture of the Polytechnic University of Madrid with my final master's dissertation HyperMobile Commuter City where I combined strategic urban planning and architectural interventions with the use of massive urban mobility data. Since then, I have been working as a freelance designer and as a researcher in academia developing projects on the topics I have been working since I entered school: at the intersection of architecture and urbanism with new technologies. State-of-the-art technologies are able to re-focus design on social and human issues and to provide to practitioners expanded capabilities for their decision making and to amaze and improve users' life quality. I came to Pittsburgh as Fulbright Scholar precisely for reinforcing my skills on a plethora of cutting-edge computational techniques on AI, machine learning, algorithmic thinking or computer vision, while keeping a critical eye. Now, the challenge is designing with both disciplines on the mind, and that is what I am doing now on my thesis on data collection using computer vision and machine learning techniques for informing urban decision and policy making.
