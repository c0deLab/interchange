Hello! I'm a fourth-year Bachelor of Architecture student with a second major in Social & Political History. Last summer I had a great experience interning with Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill in San Francisco. Throughout the year, I regularly freelance for the graphics and marketing firm Spin350 Creative from Boston. At school, I'm involved as an editor of interÂ·punct, the school's architectural theory and publications group, and am a fourth-time nominated representative of the Student Advisory Council. Feel free to reach out, I'm always happy to have a conversation!
