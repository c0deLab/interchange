I am a 4th-year B.Arch student, minoring in HCI. I have a passion for visual representation, programming and interactive design.

I wish to strengthen my visual design skills and explore UX design through an internship in summer 2018. I am especially interested in the realm of mixed reality, physical interaction, and computational design.
