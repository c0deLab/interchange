I am currently a fifth year architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University. I have high interest in detailing, fabrication, and digital modelling. I enjoy working with projects that I can put my hands on and experience the process starting from schematic design phase to completion. It is the best thing to experience something get built after all the work done.
