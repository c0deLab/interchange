My name is Jessica Sved. I was born and raised in a humble home in Miami, Florida. Since leaving, I have tried to travel as much as possible to see as much of the world as I could. Every experience has been an opportunity to reevaluate how things work, which I hope to continue in my work.

I have also been working within the university housing department for the last two years. I have had the chance to gain knowledge about facility management and to use my creative skills in small-scale projects.
