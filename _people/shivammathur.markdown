I have recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master of Science in Architecture-Engineering-Construction Management. I have gained hands-on experience in project coordination and supervision after working with a Real Estate Developer for two years. I would be delighted to start my professional career with an organization I can learn from, and grow with.
