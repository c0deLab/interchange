I am a fourth year B. Arch student minoring in Architectural History. I am pursuing professional licensure upon my graduation in May 2019.

I am passionate and driven to create spaces that inspire people and raise the standard of living. I strongly believe that architecture must be respect its social and environmental context, and seek to improve them.

My upbringing and education in a variety of multicultural contexts has made me an explorer who is always keen to discover new things and broaden my horizons. Some of my recent explorations have made me keen to explore the world of theatre / performing arts space design, and lighting design. 

Upon graduation, I aim to become a licensed architect.
