â€‹My name is Francis (Fan) Yang, and I will graduate in May 2018 with the B.Arch. degree. I am seeking one-year full time employment between June 2018 to June 2019. In terms of design, I am interested in creating space with rich experience and meaningful narrative. I believed that architecture has dimensions that enable us to define life in a poetic & dignified way. Through the employment, I hope to gain direct experience that bridge the gap between design concept and the technical constraint in construction.
