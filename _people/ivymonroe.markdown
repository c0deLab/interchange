Ivy Monroe is a 5th year student pursuing a Bachelors of Architecture with a Minor in Photography, graduating in May. Her architectural practice follows her instincts through a practiced form of apophenia to create spaces that interrogate and augment our human relationships to the natural world, searching for what could be. She is an active artist, arts educator, and LGBTQ+ advocate.
