I am currently a fifth-year B.Arch undergraduate student pursuing a thesis project as the capstone to my academic career. My interest in culture and activating the built environment inspired me to minor in both Architectural History and Intelligent Environments through Carnegie Mellon's IDeATe program. Serving others re-energizes me and every conversation I have inspires me. This motivates me to create spaces and experiences that encourage conversation and connection between people inhabiting them.
