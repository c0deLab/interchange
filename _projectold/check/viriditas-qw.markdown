NASA projects a possible human presence on Mars as early as 2030s. Before such an event can happen, we must develop systems capable of sustaining life on the red planet, lightweight and small enough to make the journey and resilient enough to survive without help from home. We developed a VR simulation of the Mars habitats to visualize it before we can actually build it.
