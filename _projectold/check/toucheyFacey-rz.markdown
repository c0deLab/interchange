Touchey Facey is an experience for two people which requires them to transgress usual social boundaries: one person touches the other’s face, repeatedly and deliberately, while a Kinect records the exact locations the touches occur in three-dimensional space. The result is a point cloud that serves as a map of an unusually intimate encounter.

The project is an answer to a question: what would it look like to use your finger as a probe to describe another person’s body? Relying on a kind of touching that is not typically condoned between any except intimate partners, though not at all necessarily erotic, a Makey Makey sends a keystroke to a computer when one person’s finger completes a circuit with the other’s body. The touching finger has a colored marker so that a simple computer vision procedure can locate it; when the Makey Makey detects a touch, data from a Kinect is parsed to record the exact location the touch happened. In this way, a map of a face (or any other conductive surface) is built up.

Observing the patterns of face touches recorded with the system, certain interesting patterns emerge; these are, after all, maps of the places that people touched each other. They represent, in this sense, a kind of map of comfort and discomfort. People frequently do not touch each others’ eyes (perhaps because they are very delicate and sensitive?), but even less often do they touch each others’ lips (perhaps because of their traditionally highly intimate role in kissing).
