HyperMobile Commuter City (HCC) is an analysis system of movement flows which detects and makes the most the existing speeds in the city by designing a complex commuter center in the area with higher daily movement of people within Madrid.

It is actually a set of interconnected projects, spanning from territorial to building scale, from data analytics to algorithmic thinking and shape finding and structural optimization. Visit [link](http://jard.us) for getting a flavour of the different component which are presented here together

DYSFUNCTIONAL CITY
One of the first interests which generated the project was the worry about the importance of the city over the architecture. This is not a negation of architecture, but recognizing than urban decisions affect much deeper people daily life than just the architectonic objects, although the belong to the same creative process.
The 80% of mobility in cities is as average caused by commuting. Urban sprawl during the 20th century has provoked the dissociation between residential and working areas. As consequence, a big amount of time is used for daily essential trips. Those massive flows direct the fast infrastructure network, always between home and work. None of the trips linked to other needs such as education, leisure or health; neither the functional dispersion in the suburbs, are effectively covered by those infrastructures. Only the private vehicle can solve the lack of compactness of suburbs. Modeling the dynamic behavior of the inhabitants of an urban area allows massive data analysis, patterns evaluation and an automatic detection of those points where an opportunistic use of the fast infrastructures of the city can program and maximize uses belonging to a compact and mixed city along the population displacement vector.
HyperMobile Commuter City (HCC) is an analysis system of movement flows which detects and makes the most the existing speeds in the city for setting out action alternative than those considered by the existing PAUs and general urban plans.
Opposed to a mobility which gives priority to individual trips, collective trips are encouraged and simultaneous common interests are used for producing meeting and activity spots.
HCC has been awarded by the Spanish National Research Council with the 1st prize in the area of Engineering and Architecture for predoc research (Arquímedes ’15).

BIG DATA AND PROGRAMMING
Opposed to static analysis and considerations based on sensitive aspects of the city, and instead of an urban development model which promotes an economical use of territory; the current availability of a huge amount of data in live or gathered according to temporized locations, speeds, conditions and needs across the city allows to set out a new paradigm of work, analysis, evaluation and urban project.
However, this new paradigm is not only possible due to the permanent monitoring process where we are in a conscious or unconscious way (through many different personal devices). It is above all possible because of the existence of management tools which allow to transform that huge amount of data into operative information.
This way, coding, evaluation, generation and testing routines can be created. If oriented correctly, they can provoke the automatic resolution of projects and different situations. In any part of the process, it can be hybridized with discretionary decisions. So, the grade of automatism of the resulting project would depend on the number of discretionary interferences introduced in the programmed routines.

The automatic project, this one which is not drawn at all and manually iterated by the designer/architect, is the other center of interest for the overall project. Instead of this, the designer/architect is responsible for coding and preparing the different routines which drive to a particular architectural object.
In the presented project, two solutions are exposed: the one resulting from a completely automatic solution of the project, and an intermediate degree of automation where only the occupation strategy is considered to be developed later as a more conventional and orthodox architectural project.

THE COLONIZED INFRASTRUCTURE
Among the identified points through the complex analysis, the intersection of the beltway M-30 and the railway tracks heading to Atocha station is one of the spots of the city of Madrid with a highest traffic of commuters. At the same time, it means a double border within the urban scene: both powerful infrastructures break streets network up. Among all the gateways to the central core of Madrid, this one shows one of the highest intensities of traffic, more available space and more opportunities of development.

From the complex analysis, the HCC at Abroñigal is conceived as a large spans superstructure. A programmed bridge which links city with city, transport infrastructure with transport infrastructure, and at the same time those categories between them. It is not just a simple transport hub, but a compact neighborhood for commuters and linked to mass transit systems. The HCC is a street-bridge, covered, mixed, at the same time space for staying, for activities and for circulation.

The elevation over the ground level, the spatial occupation by large scale infrastructures and the presence of an ensemble of orographic and infrastructural conditions force to plan a continuous project (because of the intrinsic lineal character of the infrastructures) with concentrated and discontinuous implementation.
The overall building description responds to a superposition of several layers: [01] programmed roof- in-outdoors links; [02] commuters’ city, hypermobile and temporal; [03] integrated exchanges, platforms within the complex system; [04] retail node, daily and domestic task core; and finally the large structure. The accessibility to the whole complex is assured by a really smooth longitudinal profile shaped by a continuous ramp always below 2% of slope.

The structure gets its main reference in the cantilever typology of bridges, one of the landmarks of the historical and contemporary railways public works. The usual assumption of larger spans require larger section is replaced by a higher density (structural and programmatic) at the supports. It meets as well the vertical communications requirements in a clearly layered building whose only points which link it to the ground are the supports.
The overall design of the building-superstructure responds at the same time to local requirements and to infrastructural conditions. The building finally gives back to the city an extensive public space which has been occupied by heavy infrastructure for more than 150 years.
